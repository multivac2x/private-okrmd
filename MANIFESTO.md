# The Objectives and Key Results in Markdown (OKRMD) Manifesto

**Version 0.1** · **February 19, 2026**

---

We are entering an era where teams are no longer only human. AI agents sit beside us — writing code, analyzing data, drafting documents, making decisions. The frameworks we inherited were not built for this. OKR was built for alignment. Scrum was built for iteration. Neither was built for a world where half your team runs on tokens instead of coffee.

OKRMD bridges that gap. It is a standard for defining objectives, planning work, and executing with precision — in plain markdown files that humans read naturally and AI agents parse natively. One format. One source of truth. Every teammate speaks it.

Every living system has a heartbeat. A human heart pulses blood through the body. A processor pulses with each clock cycle through silicon. A healthy team pulses work through its pipeline in a steady rhythm. OKRMD makes that pulse visible — in files you can read, track, and trust.

We believe:

---

**I. Plain text will rule the world.**

Databases get deprecated. Platforms get acquired. Proprietary formats die with the companies that made them. A markdown file in a Git repository will be readable in fifty years by any editor, any agent, any system not yet invented. Your strategy, your plans, your history — they deserve permanence. OKRMD stores everything in `.md` files because plain text is the only format that answers to no vendor.

**II. Every pulse of work must know its purpose.**

A task disconnected from strategy is just motion — a heartbeat without a body. In OKRMD, every task traces to a story, every story to an epic, every epic through a phase to a key result, every key result to an objective. The pulse flows from purpose to execution and back. If the thread from a single focus session to a company-wide goal is broken, the system tells you. Fix the thread before you fix the task.

**III. Humans and agents are teammates.**

An AI agent assigned a story deserves the same clarity a human does: context, constraints, acceptance criteria, and a definition of done. A human reviewing an agent's work deserves full transparency: what was attempted, what was decided, what remains uncertain. OKRMD treats both as first-class team members — with profiles, assignments, pulse logs, and performance history. Respect is a protocol, not a preference.

**IV. Rhythm over heroics.**

Sustainable teams have a heartbeat. OKRMD calls each beat a Pulse — a bounded interval of focused effort followed by rest or reflection. For humans, a Pulse is twenty-five minutes of deep work and a body that needs to breathe. For agents, a Pulse is one context window of execution and a checkpoint before the next. A human heart rests between contractions. A processor idles between cycles. Neither should run until they crash. The best teams are not the fastest. They are the most steady.

**V. Autonomy is a spectrum, not a switch.**

Not every task needs a human watching. Not every task should run unsupervised. OKRMD defines five autonomy levels — A1 through A5 — written explicitly in every work item. A1: the agent operates independently. A5: the human drives without agent involvement. The levels between are where collaboration lives. If your team cannot agree on the level, you do not yet understand the task.

**VI. Ship in phases, not all at once.**

An MVP is not a lesser product. It is a deliberate boundary — a gate where you measure, learn, and decide. OKRMD sequences ambition into phases, each with explicit criteria for proceeding. Ship Phase 1. Evaluate. Then decide whether Phase 2 is still the right next step. Strategy is not a plan you follow. It is a series of informed decisions.

**VII. Unplanned work is still work.**

Servers crash at midnight. Critical bugs surface on launch day. A client calls with an urgent request that fits no epic and no sprint. A framework that cannot accommodate the unplanned will be abandoned on the first bad Monday. OKRMD gives orphan tasks a home — tracked, measured, and reviewed with the same rigor as planned work, because pretending they don't exist doesn't make them go away.

**VIII. The file is the single source of truth.**

If the markdown file says "in progress" and the project board says "done," the file is right. If the acceptance criteria in the file differ from the Slack thread, the file wins. OKRMD files are version-controlled, diffable, and auditable. One source. One truth. Updated where the work happens, not in a dashboard someone checks once a week.

**IX. Context is finite — budget it.**

A human's attention and an AI's context window are the same constraint in different bodies. Both degrade with overload. Both recover with rest. OKRMD structures work to fit within these windows: stories sized for comprehension, tasks scoped for a single Pulse, checkpoints before the window closes. Respect the limits of the mind you're working with — carbon or silicon.

**X. Measure outcomes, not activity.**

Pulse counts are data. Velocity is a tool. But the only metric that matters at quarter's end is the OKR score: did the key result move? A feature shipped in two hundred Pulses and a feature shipped in twenty have the same value if the objective advanced. OKRMD tracks effort to improve estimation, but judges success by outcomes alone.

---

*OKRMD is not a replacement for the frameworks that came before it. It is their unification — extended into a world they did not anticipate.*

*One heart beats with muscle. Another beats with silicon. The rhythm is the same. The pulse is shared. And the work is written where both can read it — in plain text, versioned, and true.*

*Plain markdown will rule the AI era. And through it, humans and agents will build together — aligned, measured, and steady.*
